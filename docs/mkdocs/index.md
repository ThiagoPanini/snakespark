# sparksnake

## Overview

The *sparksnake* library provides an easy, fast, and efficient way to use Spark features inside analytics services on AWS. With *sparksnake*, it is possible to use classes, methods and functions developed in pyspark to simplify, as much as possible, the journey of building Spark applications along all the particularities found in AWS services, such as Glue and EMR, for example.

Do you want to take your job Glue or your EMR cluster to the next level? Take a look at *sparksnake*!

## Features

- ü§ñ Simplification of building Spark applications with already coded classes and methods
- üåü Consolidation of most common functionalities involving ETL processes in pyspark
- ‚öôÔ∏è Abstraction of the whole process of setting up a Job Glue with one line of code
- üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Application observability improvement with detailed log messages in CloudWatch
- üõ†Ô∏è Exception handling processes already embedded in library methods


## Getting Started

The latest version of the sparksnake library is already published in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sparksnake/) and available free of charge for anyone interested in improving the creation of their Spark applications using AWS services such as Glue and EMR. To start your journey, simply perform your installation using the following command:

```bash
pip install sparksnake
```

??? tip "About Python virtual environments"
    In general, it's a good practice create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) before the start of every Python project. Creating a venv for each Python project allows, among other advantages, to have an isolated environment with more refined control over the dependencies used.
    
    ??? example "Creating virtual environments"
        To create a Python virtual environment, run the following code in a folder of your preference (maybe one you can use for organizing all your further virtual environments):

        ```bash
        python -m venv <venv_name>
        ```

        Where `<venv_name>` should be replaced by the name chosen for the virtual environment to be created. It is common to have virtual environment names associated with projects (ex: `project_venv`)


    ??? example "Accessing virtual environments"
        Once created, the environment needs to be explicitly accessed by the user to ensure that all subsequent actions related to installing libraries are actually performed inside of the isolated environment created.

        If the operating system used is Windows, then use the command below to access the Python virtual environment:

        ```bash
        # Accessing venvs on Windows
        <venv_path>/Scripts/activate
        ```

        In case of use of a Linux operating system (or Git Bash in Windows), the command has minor changes and is given by:

        ```bash
        # Accessing venvs on Linux
        source <venv_path>/Scripts/activate
        ```

        Where `<venv_path>` is the location reference of the newly created virtual environment. For example, if you created a virtual environment named *test_venv* name in your user directory, then `<venv_path>` can be replaced by `C:\Users\username\test_venv` on Windows or simply `~/test_venv` on Linux.
