# Sparksnake: Taking Spark to the Next Level

## Overview

The *sparksnake* library provides a set of tools to enhance the development of Spark applications, specially if they are meant to be deployed and used in AWS services, such as Glue and EMR. The idea behind *sparksnake* is to delivery methods written in `pyspark` that make everything easier: the user will have the ability to execute common Spark operations with a few lines of code.

- Have you ever wanted to improve your Spark code with log messages and exception handling?
- Have you ever wanted to go in a deep dive in AWS services with Spark but you got stuck setting up your code?
- Have you ever wanted to optimize your 1k+ lines of Spark code deployed on AWS?

✨ Try *sparksnake*!
