## Features

- ü§ñ Apply common Spark operations using few lines of code
- üíª Start developing your Spark applications anywhere using the "default" mode or in any AWS services that uses Spark
- ‚è≥ Stop spending time setting up the boring stuff of your Spark applications
- üí° Apply the best practices on your application by structuring your code following the best practices
- üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Improve your aplication's observability by using detailed log messages on CloudWatch and exception handlers


## How Does it Work?

Whenever users need to simplify the development of their Spark applications, the *sparksnake* Python library can be used. It is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sparksnake/) and can be installed using the `pip install sparksnake` command. One of the main goals of *sparksnake* is to put together common Spark operations as class methods that follows the best practices and can be used in any pyspark application.

The *sparksnake* library also helps users that are deploying Spark applications on AWS services like Glue and EMR by providing an elegant and easy way to execute specific Spark operations used on those services. For example, you can initialize a Glue job, get all job arguments and get all session and context elements using a single `init_job()` method.

But don't worry! Everything you need to know about *sparksnake* is on this documentation page. Enjoy the read and don't miss the oportunity to start using this huge solution.

## Combining Solutions

The *sparksnake* Python package isn't alone. There are other complementary open source solutions that can be put together to enable the full power of learning analytics on AWS. [Check it out](https://github.com/ThiagoPanini) if you think they could be useful for you!
